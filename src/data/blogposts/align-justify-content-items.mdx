description: A review of four basic CSS Grid and Flexbox properties that confuse me. Probably more for my benefit that yours.
---

CSS Grid and Flexbox are very helpful tools that I employ often when making web applications. There are four properties that overlap in both Grid and Flexbox that I use often, but I usually have to look up what they do to find the exact properties and values I want to use. These four are:

- `justify items`
- `align items`
- `justify content`
- `align content`

My intention here is that I (and hopefully others) can look at this page to quickly find the right property and values to get the intended layout. Hopefully it doesn't end up being as long as the aforementioned long pages.

Also, a caveat: `justify-items` doesn't exist in Flexbox. Nonetheless, I'll discuss it here.

## 1: justify-items / align-items[^1]

These properties define where items within the grid / box sit in their container. `justify-items` situates things on the main axis, whereas `align-items` is on the cross axis. This means that by default, _align = vertical, justify = horizontal._

#### Examples

Let's start with a simple grid layout and do some experimentation. This CSS:

```css title="test"
.grid {
  display: grid;
  background: red;
  padding: 10px;
  gap: 10px;
}

.grid-item {
  background: white;
}
```

with this HTML:

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="grid-item">item</div>
  <div class="grid-item">item</div>
</div>
```

gives us:

<SizedImage imageSrc="/blog/grid-1.png" />

Here's our starting point. We have an explicit grid with two items, which seem to stretch to fill their available space. Also, the text is in the top left corner of each item. If we add the line:

```css
justify-items: center;
```

then the `div`'s in our grid are horizontally centered, but vertically unaffected.

<SizedImage imageSrc="/blog/grid-2.png" />

Or if we wanted to vertically align our items toward the end of their containers:

```css
align-items: end;
```

<SizedImage imageSrc="/blog/grid-3.png" />

Both of our items are vertically aligned toward the end of their grid space. As you might assume, both properties have the value `stretch` by default. You can see this at work in the last two pictures. When one axis is aligned, the other axis still stretches to fill the remaining.

Also, you can set both values in one line by using the `place-items` property and separating the values with a slash (e.g. `center / center`).

## 2: justify-content / align-content[^2]

The last two properties change where items sit within the grid space allocated for them, but do not change the location of the grid space. If our content is smaller than our grid container, it would be nice to specify where the allocated space goes, not just the items within the space. Luckily, that's exactly what these next two properties do.

#### Examples

Let's say we want to stack our items on the bottom of the grid. Well, we just tried using the `align-items` property, which affects the vertical axis, but we didn't get exactly what we're looking for. Let's try `align-content`.

```css
align-content: end;
```

<SizedImage imageSrc="/blog/grid-4.png" />

Instead of the content being being centered within their allocated grid space, that grid space itself has moved. That's a little confusing, so let's use Chrome dev tools to see this more clearly. Here's the grid with `align-items: end;`

<SizedImage imageSrc="/blog/grid-5.png" />

And with `align-content: end;`

<SizedImage imageSrc="/blog/grid-6.png" />

This clears up exactly what's going on. `align-items` changes where the items are within their allocated space (dotted lined boxes), but keeps this space stretched. `align-content`, on the other hand, changes where the space itself is.

The `justify/align content` properties also have the values `space-evenly` or `space-between`. These space items evenly within a grid, either counting the walls as other items or pushing items against the container.

To space evenly with the walls:

```css
align-content: space-evenly;
```

<SizedImage imageSrc="/blog/grid-7.png" />

Or, to have items press up against the container:

```css
align-content: space-between;
```

<SizedImage imageSrc="/blog/grid-8.png" />

As with the first two properties, you can set values for these last two in one line by using the `place-content` property.

All of these properties can get a little bit confusing. For example, writing

```css
align-content: stretch;
```

will do exactly the same thing as

```css
align-items: stretch;
```

a lot of the time. If you want to align things in the start/center/end, It's probably a reasonable strategy to start with the items-based properties, and then try content if that doesn't seem to work. But for spacing things evenly, the `content` would be a good place to start.

I think that's pretty much it! Hopefully this clears up these four CSS properties.

[^1]: Values: start, end, center, stretch (default)
[^2]: Values: start, end, center, stretch (default), space-around, space-between, space-evenly
